Weather app made to improve my coding and styling skills. App use [API](https://openweathermap.org) to fetch global weather data. If you enable geolocation, your city weather will be displayed, else default city weather is displayed. Add city to your favourites, so you can faster check weather for this cities. App use local storage to store users favourite cities.

The background color of app depends on weather conditions in the city you check weather for. Dark mode is also available, but background color will always be dark.
